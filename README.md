# CIS 700 Midterm by Ravjot Sachdev

## Topic 1: Evading Malware Detection

For this topic, I selected the MalGAN project. The original code can be found at https://github.com/ZaydH/MalwareGAN/

The only needed change was a change to malgan/_log_tools.py on line 41. Certain special characters were preventing Windows compatability.

The notebook for this topic is named Ravjot_Sachdev_MalGAN.ipynb. This notebook contains the relevant output and report.

The relevant code can be found in the MalwareGAN directory.


## Topic 2: Evading Malware Adversarial Attacks for Graph Data

For this topic, I selected the Nettack project. The original code can be found at https://github.com/danielzuegner/nettack

No changes were needed for this project. I did have some difficulty with the required packages, as numpy>1.20 was not compatible with some of the code, but this was solved by installing numpy 1.16.1.

The notebook for this topic is named Ravjot_Sachdev_Nettack.ipynb. This notebook contains the relevant output and report.

The relevant code can be found in the nettack directory.
